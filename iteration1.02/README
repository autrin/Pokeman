This program constructs a vast, procedively generated world for exploration in a text-based format, structured as a grid of maps each 80 
characters wide and 21 characters tall. The heart of the system is a two-dimensional array of pointers, where each pointer can dynamically 
allocate a map when explored. The `world_init` function sets up this framework, marking all maps as unexplored (NULL) initially, centered 
around a predefined starting point.

As players move or 'fly' to new coordinates, the program checks if a map at the new location exists. If not, it generates one on-the-fly 
using the `newMapCaller` function. This generation process involves creating distinct regions within each map, each with its own terrain 
type denoted by specific characters (e.g., water, grass, rock). This is achieved by first dividing the map into sections, then randomly 
assigning a terrain symbol to each, ensuring a diverse and engaging environment.

To connect these maps, the program strategically places paths and exits that align with adjacent maps, ensuring a seamless world where 
every move to the edge of a map leads to another map. Exits are determined dynamically based on the existence and layout of neighboring 
maps to maintain continuity.

Special features like Pokémon Centers and Pokémarts are added based on certain conditions, such as the map's distance from the world center 
or random chance, further enriching the exploration experience.

The program meticulously manages memory, allocating space for each new map and its contents only when needed and ensuring all allocated memory 
is freed appropriately to prevent leaks. This efficient memory handling allows the program to simulate a virtually endless world without 
excessive resource consumption.

Overall, the code intricately weaves together dynamic memory management, procedural generation, and strategic layout planning to create a complex 
and immersive text-based game world.
