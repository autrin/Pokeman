Character Movement and Behavior: Characters in the simulation, including the player character (PC), NPCs (Non-Playable Characters such as hikers, rivals, 
and others), exhibit distinct movement patterns. NPCs move according to their specific behaviors (e.g., hikers, rivals, wanderers), making the world feel 
alive and dynamic. The movement system is governed by a pathfinding algorithm, factoring in terrain costs to determine the most efficient paths for character
movements.

Simulation Loop: A game loop drives the simulation, handling character actions, movements, and interactions within the game world. Characters take turns based 
on a priority queue, allowing for orderly execution of actions in the simulated environment.

Interaction with the Environment: Characters can interact with the environment, such as traversing different terrains, encountering obstacles like boulders 
and trees, and potentially engaging with special terrain features like Pokecenters and Pokemarts, which are placed using specific rules to ensure accessibility
and challenge.
