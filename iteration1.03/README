In iteration 1.03 of the project, we focus on a pathfinding system based on Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest paths for two character types (Hiker and Rival) navigating through the terrain. To use Dijkstra, I included a priority queue, in this case min heap. I learned its implementation from resources provided to us in the class. These characters dynamically find the most efficient route towards the player's current position, considering the terrain's traversal cost.
Now, the player character, '@', is also in the map.
Moreover, I used Perlin noise to enhance generating varied and realistic terrain types, including grass, clearings, trees, boulders, and water, across the map. This iteration builds towards a more immersive and strategically demanding environment, where terrain influences movement.
